BCLExtensions
=============

BCLExtensions is an extension method library for .NET 3.5 or higher or for .NET Core which offers various extension methods for classes in the .NET Base Class Library (BCL)

BCL Extensions is a small library which extends what is shipped with .NET 3.5+ / .NET Core. Please consult the [Documentation](https://github.com/SolutionsDesign/BCLExtensions/wiki) for further details. BCL Extensions is used by [LLBLGen Pro v3 and up](http://www.llblgen.com/) and the algorithm and data-structures library [Algorithmia](https://github.com/SolutionsDesign/Algorithmia) and has been used in production successfully since May 2010.

### .NET Core support
All functionality is there, except the DataSet/Table extension methods as .NET Core doesn't support these types. 

### Getting a binary version via NuGet

BCL Extensions is also [available on Nuget](https://nuget.org/packages/SD.Tools.BCLExtensions/).
